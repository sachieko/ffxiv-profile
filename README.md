# ffxiv-profile
An app which displays information and images for a character, used by the ffxiv roleplaying community.

It is currently deployed at [MIGRATING FROM NETLIFY :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and uses the Imgur API to fetch images from an album to populate a gallery.

This project was built using Typescript in React.
